Online marketplace for buying and selling items

## Description

This Online marketplace full stack application will allow for users to buy, sell and post goods. Other users will be able to view those goods and decide if they would like to purchase those goods. The application solves the real-world problem of being able to search for particular goods that users want or need. Additionally, it will allow for users to sell goods as well. This web application will have a robust back end - with servers, databases, advanced APIs and user authentication. It will also have an intuitive front end.The web application utilizes Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, MySQL, Sequelize ORM, GET and POST routes, Passport.js and will be deployed using Heroku. It has a polished UI, is responsive and interactive. It meets good-quality coding standards, and folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
